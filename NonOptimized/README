Program Purpose:
----------------
    The purpose of this program is to take in a filename of cities and find the 
    shortest path between two cities entered by the client using A-star search. 

    *This program is written in C++.

Compile/run:
-----------
    Compile using:
        make 
    Run executable with:
        ./astar_search filename

Notes:
------
    - for longer searches(ie. New York to London), there is some wait time 
      between when the search information is printed and when the program 
      prompts to search again or quit, this is the program reseting itself to 
      prepare for a new search
